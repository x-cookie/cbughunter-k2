## 41. LinkedIn Employee Enumeration

LinkedIn is the highest-signal source for employee enumeration during external red-team work. Use it for: target list generation, role prioritization, email-pattern derivation, pretext development.

### 41.1 Search techniques

**Free LinkedIn (no Sales Navigator):**
- People-search by company: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=["<company-id>"]`. Get company-id from the company's LinkedIn URL or profile JSON.
- Bypass connection-degree filter: search shows 1st/2nd-degree only by default; use Google dorking instead.

**Google dork for LinkedIn employee enum:**
```
site:linkedin.com/in "<company name>"
site:linkedin.com/in "<company name>" "engineer"   # role filter
site:linkedin.com/in "<company name>" "<location>" # location filter
site:linkedin.com/in "<company name>" -inurl:/posts
```

**Bing/DuckDuckGo equivalents** — sometimes return different result sets; cross-engine union.

**LinkedIn Sales Navigator (paid):**
- Most efficient if available. Lead lists by company × role × seniority. Export CSV.

**Tools:**
- **theHarvester** with `-b linkedin` source (uses search-engine-driven enum).
- **CrossLinked** — `https://github.com/m8r0wn/CrossLinked` — CLI tool that does the LinkedIn dorking.
- **LinkedInDumper** / **Linkook** — open-source enum tools (verify currency; they break frequently).
- **PhantomBuster** / **Apollo.io** / **RocketReach** / **Hunter.io Email Finder** — paid SaaS that does the enum + email derivation in one workflow.

### 41.2 Role inference for prioritization

For each enumerated employee, capture:
- **Name** (canonical form: First Last; remove suffixes like "PMP", "PhD" for email-pattern matching).
- **Job title** (raw + normalized to a role tier).
- **Tenure** (years at company; longer = more access typically).
- **Location** (city / region; informs phishing time-of-day).
- **Recent activity** (posts, comments, articles — informs pretext).

**Role priority for breach lookup + phishing target list:**

| Role tier | Examples | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | CEO, CFO, CTO, CISO, CIO, COO, GC, CRO | Exec accounts; BEC + finance + legal authority. |
| **P1** | VP / Director of IT / Security / Engineering / Finance / HR | Privileged tool access; reset workflows. |
| **P2** | DevOps, SRE, Platform, Security Engineer, DBA | GitHub / cloud / CI access; secrets in their accounts. |
| **P3** | Software Engineer, Architect, Senior Developer | Code + occasional cloud access. |
| **P4** | Sales, Marketing, HR, Finance Analyst, Customer Support | SaaS access (Salesforce, HubSpot, Workday); BEC enabler. |
| **P5** | Generic individual contributor, intern, contractor | Lowest single-account value but breadth matters. |

### 41.3 Email-pattern derivation from confirmed names

For each captured name, derive candidate emails using §11 templates. Cross-reference against:
- Hunter.io `domain-search` to confirm pattern.
- Breach corpus (HudsonRock + HIBP + DeHashed + IntelX) to find matches.

### 41.4 Sock-puppet considerations

- **Never connect from the corporate persona.** LinkedIn shows "viewed your profile" notifications.
- **Use a sock puppet** with a plausible profile (5+ years built history, similar industry, mutual connections to throw off correlation). Tools: persona-builder workflows.
- **LinkedIn "private mode" (anonymous viewing)** — toggle in settings; reduces one signal but Sales Navigator can still see anonymized "someone viewed your profile."
- **Connection requests are detectable.** Don't send any during recon.
- **Profile views accumulate suspicion** if you view 100+ employees of one company in a day. Throttle: <20/day per persona.

### 41.5 Output

Per discovered employee:
```
Person:
  name:        "Alice Doe"
  title:       "Senior DevOps Engineer"
  role_tier:   P2
  company:     "Acme Corp"
  location:    "Boston, MA"
  linkedin_url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicedoe
  derived_emails:
    - alice.doe@acme.com    (TENTATIVE)
    - adoe@acme.com         (TENTATIVE)
    - alice@acme.com        (TENTATIVE)
  breach_hits:
    - alice.doe@acme.com    (HudsonRock; cleartext password redacted; FIRM)
  pretext_hooks:
    - "DevOps tooling vendor evaluation" (recent posts)
    - "Boston DevOps Days speaker" (conference activity)
```

## 42. Job Posting Tech-Stack Analysis

Job postings reveal the target's internal tech stack with surprising precision. Free, public, and they include the exact vendor names.

### 42.1 Sources

| Platform | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn Jobs | `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=&f_C=<company-id>` | Most current; require LI account. |
| Indeed | `https://www.indeed.com/cmp/<company>` | Company page with job feed. |
| Glassdoor | `https://www.glassdoor.com/Jobs/<company>-Jobs-E<id>.htm` | Plus salary data + employee reviews. |
| Lever (ATS) | `https://jobs.lever.co/<company>` | Direct ATS — full job descriptions. |
| Greenhouse (ATS) | `https://boards.greenhouse.io/<company>` | Direct ATS. |
| Workable (ATS) | `https://apply.workable.com/<company>/` | Direct ATS. |
| AshbyHQ (ATS) | `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/<company>` | Direct ATS. |
| AngelList / Wellfound | `https://wellfound.com/company/<company>/jobs` | Startup-focused. |
| BuiltIn | `https://builtin.com/companies/view/<company>` | Tech-focused. |
| Stack Overflow Jobs | (deprecated 2022 but archive available) | Historical tech-stack data. |
| Company careers page | `https://careers.<target>.com` or `https://<target>.com/careers` | Direct source; sometimes more detail than ATS. |

### 42.2 What to extract

For each job posting, harvest:
- **Required technologies** ("must have experience with X, Y, Z") → confirmed in-use.
- **Nice-to-have technologies** → likely in use but maybe in transition.
- **Vendor names** (Workday, Salesforce, Snowflake, Databricks, Datadog, etc.) → SaaS tenants.
- **Internal tool / project codenames** (often slip into "you'll work on Project Aurora") → recon vocabulary.
- **Team size hints** ("part of a 12-person platform team") → org-structure intel.
- **Office locations** ("hybrid 3 days in Boston office") → physical recon.
- **Cloud + on-prem ratio hints** ("migrating from on-prem to AWS") → posture intel.
- **Compliance frameworks mentioned** (SOC2, FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI) → defensive priorities + reporting context.

### 42.3 Tooling

- **scrapy / BeautifulSoup** — custom scrapers per ATS.
- **theHarvester** with appropriate sources.
- **JobScraper** scripts on GitHub.
- **Manual** — for small targets, manual review of 20–30 postings is fast and high-fidelity.

### 42.4 Output

Per discovered tech mention:
```
Tech_inferred:
  product:     "Snowflake"
  category:    "data warehouse"
  source:      "linkedin job posting #<id>"
  source_url:  https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/...
  confidence:  TENTATIVE  (job listing implies in-use; not yet confirmed by direct probe)
  posting_date: 2026-03-15
  required_or_nice: "required"
```

Aggregate to a **target tech-stack profile** that informs:
- Which secret patterns to look for (Snowflake-specific keys, Databricks tokens).
- Which SaaS tenants to fingerprint (Snowflake account URL pattern).
- Which vendor-product fingerprints to probe (Snowflake DSN paths in JS).

## 43. Slack / Discord / Telegram Workspace Discovery

### 43.1 Slack

- **Public workspace search** (limited; Slack used to have one but deprecated):
  - **Slofile** (third-party): `https://slofile.com/` — community Slack workspace directory.
  - **Slacklist** / **Slack Communities** — community-curated lists.
- **Invite-link enumeration** — Slack invite URLs follow `https://join.slack.com/t/<workspace-slug>/shared_invite/<token>`. Common discovery:
  - Google: `site:join.slack.com "{target}"` or `inurl:slack.com inurl:shared_invite "{target}"`.
  - GitHub: `"join.slack.com/t/<target-stem>"` filename:README.
  - Twitter/X / Reddit: search for shared invite links.
- **Confirm workspace exists**: visit `https://<slug>.slack.com/api/auth.test` (returns workspace metadata when called by an authenticated session, but the page itself returns differently per workspace existence).
- **High-value finding**: any open invite link that bypasses the target's normal member-approval flow → operator can join workspace without authorization → MEDIUM/HIGH finding (depending on what's in the workspace).

### 43.2 Discord

- **Discord server discovery** is harder (no central public directory).
- **DiscordServers.com** — third-party directory.
- **Discord.me** / **Top.gg** — community directories.
- Google: `site:discord.gg "{target}"` or `site:discord.com "{target}"`.
- **Confirm server**: invite URLs `https://discord.gg/<token>` resolve to a JSON via `https://discord.com/api/v9/invites/<token>?with_counts=true`. Returns server name, ID, member count, channel info.
- **Bot enumeration**: if you find a bot token (catalog §17 row 47), use `getMe` to get bot identity + servers it's joined to (read-only check).

### 43.3 Telegram

Already covered in §38. Quick reference:
- TGStat — channel analytics + search.
- Telemetr — channel growth + overlaps.
- Combot — group analytics.
- View public channels: `https://t.me/s/<channel>`.
- Invite link enum: search Google `site:t.me "{target}"`.

### 43.4 Microsoft Teams (federation)

- See companion methodology skill §11.10.
- Federation status check via Microsoft Graph (auth-required).
- Open-federation default = anyone can chat target's users with `<email>@<target>` lookup.

### 43.5 Mattermost / Rocket.Chat / self-hosted

- `https://mattermost.<target>.com` or `chat.<target>` patterns.
- Open registration check: probe `/signup` page; if accessible without invite → anyone joins.
- Check version disclosure (`/api/v4/system/ping`) for known CVEs.

## 44. Package Registry Leak Hunting

Public package registries (npm, PyPI, RubyGems, Docker Hub, etc.) often contain inadvertent secrets in published packages.

### 44.1 npm

- **Search packages by org / scope:**
  ```bash
  npm search "<target-keyword>"
  npm view @<scope>/<package-name>
  ```
- **List org's packages:** `https://www.npmjs.com/org/<org>` or `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/org/<org>/package`.
- **Per-package historical versions:** `https://registry.npmjs.org/<package>` — JSON with all versions.
- **Tarball download for scan:**
  ```bash
  npm pack <package>@<version>
  tar -xzf package-version.tgz
  # Run secret catalog (§17) on extracted files
  ```
- **Common leaks:** `.env` files included in published tarball, `package.json` `scripts` references to internal CI secrets, hardcoded API keys in `dist/` builds.

### 44.2 PyPI

- **Search packages:** `https://pypi.org/search/?q=<target>`.
- **Per-package metadata + history:** `https://pypi.org/pypi/<package>/json`.
- **Download wheel/sdist for scan:**
  ```bash
  pip download <package>==<version> --no-deps -d /tmp/pkg
  unzip /tmp/pkg/*.whl -d /tmp/pkg/extracted
  # Run secret catalog
  ```
- **Common leaks:** `setup.py` with hardcoded URLs, embedded test fixtures with real credentials, accidentally-included `.pypirc` files.

### 44.3 RubyGems

- **Search:** `https://rubygems.org/search?query=<target>`.
- **Per-gem metadata:** `https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/<gem-name>.json`.
- **Download:**
  ```bash
  gem fetch <gem-name>
  gem unpack <gem-name>-<version>.gem
  ```

### 44.4 Cargo (Rust crates)

- **Search:** `https://crates.io/search?q=<target>`.
- **Per-crate metadata:** `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<crate-name>`.

### 44.5 Packagist (PHP / Composer)

- **Search:** `https://packagist.org/search/?q=<target>`.
- **Per-package metadata:** `https://packagist.org/packages/<vendor>/<package>.json`.

### 44.6 NuGet (.NET)

- **Search:** `https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=<target>`.

### 44.7 Maven Central (Java)

- **Search:** `https://search.maven.org/?q=<target>`.

### 44.8 Docker Hub / Quay / GHCR / ECR Public

Already covered in §16.18; worth noting for completeness as part of registry-sweep workflow.

### 44.9 Workflow

For each registry, for each candidate package owned-by-target:
1. List all historical versions (often `<package>@1.0.0` was clean but `<package>@0.9.0` had a leaked key).
2. Download each version's archive.
3. Extract; run secret catalog (§17) over all files.
4. Note `.env`, `package.json`/`setup.py`/`Cargo.toml` for hardcoded values.
5. For Docker images: scan each layer (use `dive` or `skopeo` + `docker save` + extract layers).

### 44.10 Typosquat surveillance

For every published package the target owns, generate typosquat candidates (similar names, common substitutions) and check whether they're already taken by attackers (supply-chain attack surface).

```bash
# Example: target package "acme-utils"
# Candidates: acme-util, acmeutils, acme_utils, acme.utils, ac-me-utils, etc.
for candidate in acme-util acmeutils acme_utils acme.utils ac-me-utils; do
  npm view $candidate 2>&1 | head -3
done
```

If a candidate is registered to a non-target party → MEDIUM finding (typosquat, possible supply-chain attack vector).

## 45. Sat Imagery for Physical Recon

For engagements that include a physical-touch component (badge access, tailgating, dumpster diving, on-site network), public imagery helps scout the target.

### 45.1 Sat imagery sources

| Source | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Earth Pro** | desktop app | Historical timeline; high resolution (sub-meter) for major cities. |
| **Google Maps** | maps.google.com | Current; satellite layer; street view inside building lobbies sometimes. |
| **Bing Maps Bird's Eye** | bing.com/maps | Oblique/45-degree imagery for many regions; sometimes shows building facades better than top-down. |
| **Apple Maps Look Around** | (iOS / Mac) | Street-level; 3D in major cities. |
| **Yandex Maps Panorama** | yandex.com/maps | Russia + global; sometimes higher-resolution street-level than Google. |
| **NearMap** (paid) | nearmap.com | Highest-resolution commercial; updated frequently in served regions (US/AU/NZ/CA mostly). |
| **Maxar / Planet Labs** (paid) | maxar.com / planet.com | Tasking + recent imagery. |
| **Sentinel Hub EO Browser** | apps.sentinel-hub.com | Free Sentinel-2 (10m); good for change detection. |
| **NASA Worldview** | worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov | Free; multiple sensors. |
| **Wayback ArcGIS** | livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback/ | Historical satellite. |
| **OpenStreetMap** | openstreetmap.org | Crowd-sourced map data with building outlines. |

### 45.2 What to extract for physical recon

- **Building entrance count + locations** — main entrance, employee entrances, loading docks, fire exits.
- **Parking lot ingress / egress** — single guarded entry vs open lot.
- **Fence lines + camera locations** — physical perimeter.
- **HVAC / utility access** — roof access, service entries.
- **Adjacent occupants** — neighboring tenants in same building / business park.
- **Vehicle types in lot** — proxy for executive presence + employee count.
- **Smoking area locations** — common social-engineering staging area.

### 45.3 OSINT-derived physical intel beyond satellites

- **LinkedIn employee photos** — badge templates often visible in profile photos taken at the office.
- **Glassdoor "office tour" photos** — employees post interior photos.
- **Indeed / Glassdoor reviews** — sometimes describe security culture ("loose badge enforcement", "tailgating common").
- **Instagram geotagged photos** — at the office address; reveals interior layout, badge designs, kitchen / common-area locations.
- **Public press releases** — often contain "ribbon cutting" photos of new offices showing layout + executive faces.
- **Conference talks by IT/security staff** — sometimes describe physical security setup.
- **Meetup / workshop event listings** — at the target's office; may include photos.

### 45.4 Vehicle / fleet intel

- **License plates** in LinkedIn/Instagram backgrounds — sometimes correlates to specific exec.
- **Company-branded vehicles** in sat imagery — fleet count + location.
- **Helicopter pad** / **executive parking** — clue to senior-leadership routine.

### 45.5 Discipline

- Document that imagery + photos are public-source.
- Don't trespass for "verification" — physical recon during OSINT phase = look only.
- Note imagery date — buildings change.
