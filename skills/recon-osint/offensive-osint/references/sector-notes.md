## 47. Sector-Specific Recon Notes

Most recon generalizes; some sectors have unique attack-surface elements worth flagging.

### 47.1 Healthcare

- **DICOM** (medical imaging) — port 11112, sometimes 4242 (testing).
- **HL7 v2** (clinical messaging) — port 2575 (TCP, often plaintext).
- **HL7 FHIR** (modern REST API) — typically `/fhir/R4/<resource>` paths; OAuth / SMART-on-FHIR auth posture varies wildly.
- **PACS / RIS / EHR systems** — Epic (`*.epic.com` SaaS), Cerner/Oracle Health, Allscripts/Veradigm, Athenahealth, NextGen, Meditech, eClinicalWorks. Each has known CVE history.
- **Searches:** `site:{domain} ("EHR" OR "PACS" OR "PHI" OR "HIPAA")`, `intitle:"Epic Systems" "{target}"`.
- **Severity escalation:** any PHI exposure → CRITICAL (regulatory + reputational); HL7/DICOM open without auth → CRITICAL.

### 47.2 Finance

- **SWIFT terminals** — typically internal-only; if external-facing, CRITICAL. Look for SWIFT Alliance Web Platform.
- **FIX protocol** (electronic trading) — port 9876 (common); cleartext.
- **Bloomberg terminals** — typically VDI; check for `bloomberg.com`-related auth surfaces.
- **Trading platform vendors** — Fidessa, Charles River, Eze Software, Aladdin (BlackRock).
- **Banking middleware** — Temenos T24, Finacle (Infosys), FIS, Jack Henry, Fiserv. Each has known CVE history.
- **Searches:** `site:{domain} ("PCI" OR "SOX" OR "GLBA" OR "MAS")`, `intitle:"Temenos" "{target}"`.
- **Severity escalation:** any account/balance data exposure → CRITICAL; SWIFT exposure → CRITICAL; trade-execution surface exposure → CRITICAL.

### 47.3 ICS / SCADA / OT

> **Caution:** ICS/SCADA assets often run on legacy systems where even passive scanning can cause disruption. **Do not actively probe ICS without explicit RoE coverage and operator coordination with the OT team.**

- **Modbus** — port 502 (TCP).
- **BACnet** — port 47808 (UDP).
- **Siemens S7** — port 102 (ISO-TSAP).
- **DNP3** — port 20000 (TCP).
- **EtherNet/IP** — port 44818 (TCP).
- **Niagara Framework** — port 1911, 4911, 5011, 502.
- **Honeywell EBI / Tridium** — varies.
- **GE Proficy / iFIX** — varies.
- **Common findings:** unauthenticated read access (BACnet point list, Modbus register read), default credentials on HMI panels, public-facing engineering workstations.
- **Sources:** Shodan ICS-specific filters (`port:502`, `tag:ics`), Censys, Onyphe.
- **Detectability:** medium-to-high; ICS networks often have low background traffic and are heavily monitored.

### 47.4 IoT / Consumer / SOHO

- **MQTT** — port 1883 (cleartext), 8883 (TLS). Topics often readable without auth.
- **CoAP** — port 5683 (UDP).
- **UPnP / SSDP** — port 1900 (UDP); often discloses internal device map.
- **Common router admin patterns:** `/cgi-bin/`, `/setup.cgi`, `/admin/index.html`. Default creds are the norm.
- **Camera DVRs / NVRs** — Hikvision, Dahua, Axis. Multiple CVEs.
- **Smart-home hubs** — exposed APIs sometimes leak auth tokens.

### 47.5 Government

- **`.gov` and `.mil` domains** require special engagement-scope discipline.
- **FedRAMP / FISMA / DoD CMMC** — defensive posture is generally above baseline.
- **OSINT data sources:** USAspending.gov, SAM.gov (System for Award Management), FBO.gov / sam.gov (procurement).
- **Common findings:** vendor of record disclosed in public contracts → adjacent-vendor pivot.
- **Severity:** as high or higher than commercial; political sensitivity layered on top of technical impact.

### 47.6 Maritime / Aviation / Auto

- **Maritime:** AIS (Automatic Identification System) — vessel positions; tools MarineTraffic, VesselFinder. Engine telemetry sometimes exposed via VSAT.
- **Aviation:** ADS-B (already covered §32.3); operator/airline-specific OPS data sometimes exposed.
- **Automotive:** OEM telematics backends (Tesla, GM OnStar, etc.) — typically authenticated, but APIs leak via mobile-app reverse engineering.

### 47.7 Universal sector caveat

**Most external recon techniques apply universally.** Sector-specific protocols add attack surface; sector-specific compliance regimes add reporting requirements. Don't assume "healthcare/finance/etc. has different OSINT" — the OSINT is the same; the targeted services differ.
