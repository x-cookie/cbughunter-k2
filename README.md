cbug is a Claude skill bundle adapted from real bug bounty disclosures. Each skill loads specialized context — vulnerability patterns, PoC templates, and report structures — derived from hundreds of public HackerOne and Bugcrowd reports. Skills activate by context in both Claude Chat (static analysis) and Claude Code (live target scanning). A built-in 7-Question Gate runs before every report to keep your N/A ratio clean.

---

## What it does

- **Hunt live targets** — Run `/hunt target.com` in Claude Code and get a streamed findings report with PoC steps
- **Review code statically** — Upload the skill ZIP to claude.ai, paste any code or HTTP request, and receive a structured findings artifact
- **Auto-load by context** — Skills detect their own trigger signals (JWT in input → auth skill loads, APK path → apk-redteam-pipeline loads)
- **Gate before submit** — Every finding runs the 7-Question Gate. One wrong answer kills the report
- **574+ H1 patterns** — Built from disclosed reports across SQLi, XSS, OAuth, IDOR, SSRF, RCE, and 15 other classes

## Key features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 51 skills | 8 domains: web-hunting, auth, api-infra, enterprise, red-team, recon, reporting, specialized |
| 15 slash commands | `/hunt`, `/triage`, `/report`, `/recon`, `/chain`, and 10 more |
| 7-Question Gate | Built into triage-validation — kills speculative reports before they reach a triager |
| Context auto-load | Skill triggers on URL, JWT, APK path, contract address, or domain signal |
| Chat + Code | Every skill documents which Claude environment supports it |
| Report templates | H1, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and Immunefi formats with impact-first structure |

## Quick start

```bash
# Claude Code (live target scanning)
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter
cd Claude-BugHunter
claude

# Start a hunt
/hunt https://target.com

# Or target a specific class
/hunt-sqli https://target.com/search?q=test
```

For Claude Chat (static code review):
1. Download the skill ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter/releases)
2. Upload to [claude.ai/customize/skills](https://claude.ai/customize/skills)
3. Paste your code or HTTP request and type the skill command

## Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/hunt [target]` | Full recon + vulnerability scan on a live target |
| `/hunt-sqli [target]` | SQLi-focused hunt using 12 disclosed report patterns |
| `/hunt-xss [target]` | XSS hunt across DOM, reflected, stored, and mutation variants |
| `/hunt-oauth [target]` | OAuth 2.0 and OIDC vulnerability hunt |
| `/triage` | Run the 7-Question Gate on the current finding |
| `/report` | Generate a report artifact for the current finding |
| `/recon [target]` | 5-stage recon pipeline: seed → expand → enrich → expose → report |
| `/chain` | Link recon findings into an exploit chain |
| `/intel [target]` | OSINT and threat intelligence on a target |

Full command reference in [`commands/`](./commands/)

## Hard rules

1. **Never submit without the Gate.** `/triage` runs 7 questions. One No = kill it.
2. **Every skill is a single `SKILL.md`.** Do not split skill logic across files.
3. **Authorized targets only.** These skills are for bug bounty programs and authorized red teams.
4. **Chat skills are read-only.** No live tool execution in Claude Chat environment.
